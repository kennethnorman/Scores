Thank you for your interest and support of www.sixist.co.uk. I hope you have many happy hours playing some new tracks. If you have any comments, please drop me a line via email or facebook (www.facebook.com/sixisttranscriptions).

Whilst I wouldm't be able to stop you sharing the transcriptions with your friends, obviously I'd prefer it if you refer them to the website instead!

As the full set is too big for email, I've added a download link to Google Drive where you can download the file.

Download the file to your computer, then double click the saved file (or right click and expand it). 

If you have any problems getting hold of the file, please let me know and I'll sort out an alternative. 


Many thanks,

Ken
